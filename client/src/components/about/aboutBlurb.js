    In 2017, I got my BA in Cognitive Science from Indiana
    University. Over the past eight months, I've been teaching myself 
    the MERN stack. I absolutely love building websites
    and learning about web development. Other passions of mine include 
    reading, rock climbing, and wood carving.
